A enjoyable game that tests, calculates, and improves typing speed and accuracy is known as a speed typing game. The ability to speed type is also highly helpful for developers because it increases productivity and efficiency.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

What I learned in creating this project:
  I learned and deeply understood about React hooks, useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext and such. I also learned how to create custom hooks to reinforce reusability within the development of the application. 

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
