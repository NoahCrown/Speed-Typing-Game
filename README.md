What I learned in creating this project:
  I learned and deeply understood about React hooks, useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext and such. I also learned how to create custom hooks to reinforce reusability within the development of the application. 

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

This project was done with the help of Scrimba's 'Advance React Course'
